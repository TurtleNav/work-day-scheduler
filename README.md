This app had to achieve the following acceptance criteria:
* Have a header with today's date in the human readable format: [day name],
  [month name] [day of the month] (for example: Sunday, December 3rd)
* Present the user with time blocks for each hour of the work day (generally, 9am - 5pm)
* Color-code the time blocks based on whether it reflects a time in the past,
  present, or future. Grey for past, red for present, and green for future
*
